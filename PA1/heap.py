    not have those out-of-bounds children. In order to implement an in-place heap sort,
    we will sometimes need to consider the tail part of A as out-of-bounds, even though
    elements do exist there. So instead of comparing with len(A), use the parameter n to
    determine if the child "exists" or not. If n is not provided, it defaults to None,
    which we check for and then set n to len(A).

    Since the (up to) two child trees are already min-heaps, we just need to find the right
    place for the element at i. If it is smaller than both its children, then nothing
    more needs to be done, it's already a min heap. Otherwise you should swap the root
    with the smallest child and recursively heapify that tree.

    If you determine that the element at i should swap with one of its children nodes,
    MAKE SURE you do this by calling the swap function defined above.
